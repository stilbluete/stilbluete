# About me 👋

There's not much to say about me yet.  
I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - and then later Python and SQL - to be able to build websites.  
Um, and now I'm trying to understand GitHub and Markdown.

## So, on my list:
- **HTML** - usable
- **CSS** - usable
- *JavaScript* - started
- *Python* - started
- SQL - planned
- Markdown - planned

## What I've done:
- **Built early websites using HTML4 and frames, learning from selfHTML (informal, independent)**
- **Completed several Khan Academy courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL**
- *HTML & CSS course by Brad Traversy* - not completed
- **Watched and followed the CS50 lecture series independently**
- *Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp* - almost completed
- *JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp* - started
- *Python course by Arkadiusz Włodarczyk* - started
